	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a way to describe how the running time of an
		algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps us 
		understand how efficient an algorithm is. Instead of measuring 
		exact time in seconds, we look at how the number of operations
		grows — for example, whether it grows slowly like O(1) (constant), moderately
		like O(n) (linear), or quickly like O(n²) (quadratic) as the input size increases. 
		Time complexity is usually expressed using Big O notation, which gives us a worst-case or upper-bound estimate of
		how the algorithm performs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or space 
		an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input.
		It includes both the input storage and any extra space 
		the algorithm needs during execution.</p>
