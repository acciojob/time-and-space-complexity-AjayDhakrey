  <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity is a way to describe how the running time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how efficient an algorithm is.</p>

  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with input size.</p>
